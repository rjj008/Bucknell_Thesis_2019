Code relevant to Bucknell University Masters Thesis 

Code:


1) DriveMotor_SerialInput.ino: Takes serial command which changes motor speed. This is used to control the motor spin speed of the baseball.

2) MatlabTakeData.m: Opens up relavent serial ports and DAQ sessions to take baseball wind tunnel data and control baseball system.

3) SerialOutputSpeedEncoder.ino: determines motor speed by encoder readings and gives that value to Matalbg code through serial communication.

4) TakeForceCalibrationAngle.m: Takes calibration force data for baseball weight and sting aerodynamics.
